                            <p>Making what is visible invisible, this is a question that has appealed to both designers and artists.
                                    In the emotion visualization projects, we are dealing with this question, where the invisible corresponds
                                    to emotional states of people. Making emotions visible, and maybe tangible, might increase emotional
                                    self-awareness of people and ease emotional communication between them.</p>
                            
                            <p>We are working with AR, thinking
                                    that it will become a widely used technology in the future and by using this technology seeing information such as emotional states
                                    embedded in our regular vision will become something very common. </p>
                            
                            <p>I have been implementing
                                    prototypes of our ideas on HoloLens, using Unity. Below are two strategies we have been exploring for 
                                    making emotions visible in AR.</p>

                            <p> Initially we came up with the Emotionscape concept, a hypothetical emotionally 
                                responsive space. In this concept, the spatial attributes change to reflect emotional
                                states - either what the user experiencing, what another collocated person's experiencing or one 
                                that is selected by the user. Our work has been accepted as poster presentations to

                            <p> While imagining spatial emotion representations, we realized it would also be interesting to
                                visualize the emotional states of people within separately - in fact this could have more
                                use cases and could have a more general applicability. Therefore, we started with a series of
                                exploratory workshops on how people would like to visualize their emotional states and created
                                an emotion visualization design framework for AR based on the outcomes of the workshops and literature.
                                Now, we are evaluating the framework and are planning to prototype our work in HoloLens.

                        <p> As a part of a fellow student Seyma Tasel's project, I built a personal space creation prototype on
                            HoloLens.
